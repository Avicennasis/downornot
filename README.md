Monitor the uptime of a website 

downornot checks to see if it can load a webpage and logs the result. if it can't, it also sends am email to let you know the site is down. 

I designed this to run on a remote server to check my home website is up. Mainly so it can email me if my home website/home internet is down. It can, of course, be used to monitor any website. This script is made to run on cron once a minute, though of course you can set whatever time you like.
